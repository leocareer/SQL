### Basic Queries

Here I review the basic concepts of working with relational databases. A database contains information from a company dedicated to selling products online. I focus on data related to completed transactions and the corporate information of the companies involved.

### Structure

- `/database:` Scripts for creating the database;
  - `db_data.sql:` Fills tables with data, use this file as the second;
  - `db_structure.sql:` Creates tables, use this file first;

- `/schema:` The database schema;
  - `transactions_schema.mwb:` Use this to download it for the MySQL Workbench;
  - `transactions_schema.pdf:` Use this to download the .pdf;

- `basic_queries.pdf:` The queries with the results;
- `basic_queries.sql:` The queries. Each includes a description of the task it solves, so if you're only interested in the code, feel free to browse just this file;
